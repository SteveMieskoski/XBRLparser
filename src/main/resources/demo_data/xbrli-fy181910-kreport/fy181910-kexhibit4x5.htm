If the Company elects to redeem such 4.125% EUR Notes, such redemption will take place on such date, not later than one year after publication of the Determination Notice, as the Company elects by notice in writing to the Fiscal Agent at least 60 days before such date, unless shorter notice is acceptable to the Fiscal Agent.
